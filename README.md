## Digital Analytics Program government-wide code

Provides a JavaScript file for US federal agencies to link or embed in their websites to participate in the Digital Analytics Program.

The most current version of DAP GA code is:

* [`Universal-Federated-Analytics.js`](Universal-Federated-Analytics.js) (full)
* [`Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js`](Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js) (minified)

### Participating in the DAP

On November 8, 2016, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum on ["Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf), which requires federal agencies to implement the DAP javascript code on all public facing federal websites.

The Digital Analytics Program offers a central hosting server for its minified JavaScript file at `https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js`. As of August 2018, the file is gzipped and served compressed by default, but will be served uncompressed where `Accept-Encoding: gzip` is not present in the viewer.

Agencies are encouraged to use the following HTML snippet to participate in the Digital Analytics Program:

```html
<!-- We participate in the US government's analytics program. See the data at analytics.usa.gov. -->
<script async type="text/javascript" src="https://dap.digitalgov.gov/Universal-Federated-Analytics-Min.js?agency=AGENCY" id="_fed_an_ua_tag"></script>
```

Replace `AGENCY` with your agency's standard abbreviation, such as DHS or EPA.

**Note:** If your agency does not already have an agency-specific view in DAP, all pages/sites will also need `&pua=ua-33523145-2` after the `agency=AGENCY` parameter in order to send data both to the property that contains aggregated data view and to the property that will house your agency-specific profile.

#### Known implementation issues

*Issue:* The Federated code is designed to work on all government sites whether
they already have inline site specific GA trackers or not. There is only one scenario
that is not fully supported by the Federated code, which is when a Universal
Analytics tracking code (that is using a custom/non-default tracking object) is added
right after the Federated code. In this specific scenario the Federated code will fail
in reporting the first page hit and will be able to track normally all the consecutive
hits.

Supported Scenarios:
* UA Site Specific before the Federated code (Default Tracking Object)
* UA Site Specific after the Federated code (Default Tracking Object)
* UA Site Specific before the Federated code (Custom Tracking Object)
* Classic GA Site Specific before the Federated code
* Classic GA Site Specific after the Federated code

*Issue:* The Federated tracking code doesnâ€™t fully support the older versions of
Microsoft Internet Explorer. While the Federated tracking code works with all
known browsers, some features (e.g. the YouTube tracker) may not work properly
on IE 8 and earlier versions because of YouTube API limitations

#### Transport security

The centrally hosted DAP JS is **only available over HTTPS**. Agencies should use only `https://` URLs, not protocol-relative URLs.

Additionally, an [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://https.cio.gov/hsts/) header is set with a length of 1 year, and is prepared for preloading into major web browsers. As of this writing, that header looks like this:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;preload
```

Browsers that support HSTS and which have observed this HSTS policy (either from a prior visit or through HSTS preloading) will not issue HTTP requests to `dap.digitalgov.gov` at all, even if instructed.

Together, HTTPS and HSTS offer a strong, necessary level of transport security and integrity.

#### Data integrity

The `dap.digitalgov.gov` domain is currently served by a third party content delivery network (CDN) that serves the current JavaScript referenced in the `master` branch of this GitHub repository.

Before any change of the JavaScript being served by the CDN, the owners of this repository will update the file located in the `master` branch of the repo.

This means that, barring the compromise of GitHub's systems or the CDN's systems, all changes to the code that appears on `dap.digitalgov.gov` should be publicly reflected in [this repository's commit history](https://github.com/digital-analytics-program/gov-wide-code/commits/master).

#### Appropriate Placement

The Digital Analytics Program Javascript code is intended to be implemented on "public-facing" federal government webpages. In this sense, "public-facing" webpages are defined as those that can be accessed without any authentication/login, and are not part of an otherwise "privileged session".

As such, the DAP script tag should not be placed on pages visited during logged-in sessions. Notably, other seemingly "public" pages that can be accessed without authentication may also be part of "privileged sessions"; for example, a "password reset" page that is accessed by clicking a link in an email is not appropriate for DAP code, because it assumes the visitor has the privilege of control over the email account used to provide the link.

#### Access controls

This repository is maintained in its own GitHub organization, `digital-analytics-program`, and is operated by the Digital Analytics Program team.

Only Digital Analytics Program staff have been granted write access to this repository.

**All members of the digital-analytics-program GitHub organization are required to have two-factor authentication enabled.**

#### Unit Testing

The Digital Analytics Program Javascript code is tested using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework.

All tests are located inside the [\_\_tests\_\_](__tests__) subdirectory and follow the `[function name].test.js` naming convention.

Unit tests are executed by GitHub Actions upon pull request. The CI configuration can be found at [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).

Before the tests are executed, the `Universal-Federated-Analytics.js` script is compiled from `Universal-Federated-Analytics-base.js` and `Universal-Federated-Analytics-lib.js`. Any proposed changes should be made against these two files and not to `Universal-Federated-Analytics.js`.
